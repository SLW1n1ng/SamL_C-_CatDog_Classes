Project Title: Animal Class Example

Description:
This project is a simple demonstration of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts using the Dog and Cat classes. It showcases the implementation of classes, member functions, constructors, and encapsulation.

The project consists of the following files:
- main.cpp: Contains the main function where instances of the Dog and Cat classes are created and their member functions are called.
- dog.h, dog.cpp: Defines the Dog class, including its member variables and member functions.
- cat.h, cat.cpp: Defines the Cat class, including its member variables and member functions.

Prerequisites:
- C++ compiler

Installation:
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Set up a C++ development environment if not already available.

Usage:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example:
   g++ main.cpp dog.cpp cat.cpp -o animal_class_example
3. Execute the compiled binary. For example:
   ./animal_class_example
4. Observe the output demonstrating the usage of the Dog and Cat classes.

Class Details:
1. Dog Class:
   - Member Variables: name (string), breed (string), age (int)
   - Member Functions: getName(), getBreed(), getAge(), setName(), setBreed(), setAge(), bark(), getDogInfo()

2. Cat Class:
   - Member Variables: name (string), color (string), age (int)
   - Member Functions: getName(), getColor(), getAge(), setName(), setColor(), setAge(), meow(), getCatInfo()
